# Version Control 101

So, after procrastinating for so long, I finally decided to learn how Git actually works and how version control can help in managing code better. Here’s what I’ve learned so far:

- Git setup and configuration
- Creating and committing versions
- Viewing and editing commit history
- Staging area vs. working directory
- Branching and merging
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Using `git push`, `git pull`, and `git fetch`
- Working with remote repositories
- Restoring previous versions of code
- Git aliases and `.gitignore` files
- Feature branch workflow
- **Using `git diff`** to compare changes in files
- **Git Stashing**: Temporarily saving changes with `git stash` and applying them later
- **Rebase**: Rewriting history to make your commit history cleaner
- **Pushing Code**: Pushing your local changes to a remote repository with `git push`

I’ve learned all of this from some amazing resources, especially **SuperSimple Dev** and **Hitesh Choudhary** on YouTube. Their tutorials made complex Git concepts much easier to understand. Highly recommend checking them out if you're starting out with Git!
